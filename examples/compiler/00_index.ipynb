    "# The Devito's Operator \n",
    "\n",
    "In Devito, an `Operator` carries out three fundamental tasks: generation of low-level code, JIT compilation, and execution. Overall, the lowering process performed by an `Operator` – from high-level equations to dynamically compiled and executable code – consists of multiple compiler passes, summarized in the Figure bellow. \n",

    "![Compiler Stages](https://i.ibb.co/dKjsZ72/compiler-stages.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following series of notebooks will expose key aspects of those compilation stages in a hands-on fashion. We will be exploring the heart of the `Operator` class, which can be found at `devito/operator.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples and exercices shown here are mostly taken either from tests found in the folder `devito/tests`, or from the documentation itself.\n",
