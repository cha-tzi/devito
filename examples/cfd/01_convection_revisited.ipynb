    "### Example 1b: Linear convection in 2D, revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now revisit the first example of this tutorial with an example that is better suited to the numerical scheme used in Devito. As a reminder, the governing equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}+c\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + c\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We then discretized this using forward differences in time and backward differences in space:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u_{i,j}^{n+1} = u_{i,j}^n-c \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}(u_{i,j}^n-u_{i-1,j}^n)-c \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta y}(u_{i,j}^n-u_{i,j-1}^n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous example, the system was initialised with a hat function. As easy as this example seems, it actually highlights a few limitations of finite differences and related methods:\n",
    " - The governing equation above contains spatial derivatives ($\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$). The hat, with its sharp corners, is discontinuous and therefore non-smooth, meaning that the derivatives do not exist at the corners of the hat. This means that the governing equation has no solution in the strict sense for this problem. Mathematically, this problem can be overcome by introducing weak solutions, which still exist in the presence of discontinuities, as long as the problem is smooth almost everywhere. The Finite Volume (FV), Finite Element (FEM) and related schemes are based on this weak form.\n",
    " - The finite differences method only works well if finite differences are a good approximation of the derivatives. With the chosen discretization above, this requires that $\\frac{u_{i,j}^n-u_{i-1,j}^n}{\\Delta x} \\approx \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$ and $\\frac{u_{i,j}^n-u_{i,j-1}^n}{\\Delta y} \\approx \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$. This is the case for systems with a smooth solution if $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$ are sufficiently small. But if the solution is non-smooth, as in this example, then we can't expect much regardless of the grid size.\n",
    " - First-order methods, such as the backward differences that we have used in this example, are known to create artificial diffusion. Higher-order schemes, such as central differences, avoid this problem. However, in the presence of discontinuities these methods introduce so-called spurious oscillations. These oscillations may even build up (grow infinitely) and cause the computation to diverge.\n",
    " - Discontinuities can appear by themselves for some equations (such as the Burgers equation that we discuss next), even if the initial condition is smooth. In CFD, discontinuities appear for example as shocks in the simulation of transonic flow. For this reason, numerical schemes that behave well in the presence of discontinuities have been a research subject for a long time. A thorough discussion is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but can be found in [R. LeVeque (1992): Numerical Methods for Conservation Laws, 2nd ed., Birkh√§user Verlag, pp. 8-13].\n",
    " \n",
    "In the remainder of this example, we will reproduce the results from the previous example, only this time with a smooth initial condition. This lets us observe Devito in a setting for which it is better equipped.\n",
