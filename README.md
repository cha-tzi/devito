[Devito](http://www.devitoproject.org) is a Python package to implement
optimised stencil computation from high-level symbolic problem definitions.
Devito builds on [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) and employs
automated code generation and just-in-time (JIT) compilation to execute
optimized computational kernels on multiple computer platforms, including
CPUs, GPUs, and clusters thereof.

## About Devito

Devito provides a functional language to implement sophisticated operators that
can be made up of multiple stencil computations, boundary conditions, sparse
operations (e.g., interpolation), and much more.  A typical use case is
explicit finite difference methods for approximating partial differential
equations. For example, a 2D diffusion operator may be implemented with Devito
as follows

```python
>>> grid = Grid(shape=(10, 10))
>>> f = TimeFunction(name='f', grid=grid, space_order=2)
>>> eqn = Eq(f.dt, 0.5 * f.laplace)
>>> op = Operator(Eq(f.forward, solve(eqn, f.forward)))
```

An `Operator` generates low-level code from an ordered collection of `Eq` (just
one in this simple example). This code may also be compiled and executed

```python
>>> op(t=timesteps)
```

There is virtually no limit to the complexity of an `Operator` -- the Devito
compiler will automatically analyze the input, detect and apply optimizations
(including single- and multi-node parallelism), and eventually generate code
with suitable loops and expressions.

Key features include:

* A functional language to express finite difference operators.
* Straightforward mechanisms to dynamically adjust the discretizion.
* Constructs to express sparse operators (e.g., interpolation), classic linear
  operators (e.g., convolutions), and tensor contractions.
* Seamless support for boundary conditions and adjoint operators.
* A flexible API to define custom stencils, sub-domains, sub-sampling,
  staggered grids.
* Distributed NumPy arrays over multi-node (MPI) domain decompositions.
* Generation of highly optimized parallel code (SIMD vectorization,
  CPU/GPU/multi-node parallelism, blocking, aggressive symbolic transformations
  for FLOPs reduction, etc.).
* Inspection and customization of the generated code.
* Autotuning framework to ease performance tuning.
* Smooth integration with with popular Python packages such as NumPy, SymPy,
  Dask, and SciPy, as well as machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow
  and PyTorch.

## Installation

The easiest way to try Devito is through Docker using the following commands:
```
# get the code
git clone https://github.com/devitocodes/devito.git
cd devito

# start a jupyter notebook server on port 8888
docker-compose up devito
```
After running the last command above, the terminal will display a URL like
`https://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=XXX`. Copy-paste this URL into a browser window
to start a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook session where you can go
through the [tutorials](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/tree/master/examples)
provided with Devito or create your own notebooks.

[See here](http://devitocodes.github.io/devito/download.html) for detailed installation
instructions and other options. Also look at the
[installation issues](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/wiki/Installation-Issues) we
have seen in the past. 

## Resources
