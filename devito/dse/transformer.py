         * 'noop': Do nothing.
         * 'basic': Apply common sub-expressions elimination.
         * 'advanced': Apply all transformations that will reduce the

                       namely 'basic', factorization, CSRE for time-invariants only.
         * 'speculative': Like 'advanced', but apply CSRE also to time-varying
                          sub-expressions, which might further increase the memory
                          pressure.
         * 'aggressive': Like 'speculative', but apply CSRE to any non-trivial
                         sub-expression (i.e., anything that is at least in a
                         sum-of-products form). This may substantially increase
