        The returned object, which behaves as a :class:`numpy.ndarray`, provides
        a *view* of the actual data, in row-major format. Internally, the data is
        stored in whatever layout adopted by YASK.

        Any read/write from/to the returned :class:`YaskGrid` should be performed
        assuming a row-major storage layout; behind the scenes, these accesses
        are automatically translated into whatever YASK expects, in order to pick
        the intended values.

        Abstracting away the internal storage layout adopted by YASK guarantees
        that user code works independently of the chosen Devito backend. This may
        introduce a little performance penalty when accessing data w.r.t. the
        default Devito backend. Such penalty should however be easily amortizable,
        as the time spent in running Operators is expected to be vastly greater
        than any user-level data manipulation.
