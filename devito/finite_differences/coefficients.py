class Coefficient(object):
    """
    Prepare custom FD coefficients to pass to CoefficientRules object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    deriv_order : integer
        Represents the order of the derivative being taken.
    function : Function
        Represents the function for which the supplied coefficients
        will be used.
    dimension : Dimension
        Represents the dimension with respect to which the
        derivative is being taken.
    coefficients : np.ndarray
        Represents the set of finite difference coefficients
        intended to be used in place of the standard
        coefficients (obtained from a Taylor expansion).

    Example
    -------
    >>> from devito import Grid, Function, Coefficient
    >>> grid = Grid(shape=(4, 4))
    >>> u = Function(name='u', grid=grid, space_order=2, coefficients='symbolic')
    >>> x, y = grid.dimensions

    Now define some partial d/dx FD coefficients of the Function u:

    >>> u_x_coeffs = Coefficient(1, u, x, np.array([-0.6, 0.1, 0.6]))

    And some partial d^2/dy^2 FD coefficients:

    >>> u_y2_coeffs = Coefficient(2, u, y, np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0]))
